Hey there! This application is used to complete the deployment process, guided by [the ShellManager Configuration Generator](https://github.com/td512/shellmanager-confgen). This worker executes Ansible, and joins the machine to a domain, ready for use

## So what does this playfile do?

Well, theoretically it should update the machine's IP.
